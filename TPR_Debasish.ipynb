    "In our previous semester's class, all the students ( grad and under-grad) were given a set of tasks(Copy, Paraphrase, Summerize) a set of predefined studies to generate target texts. These tasks were performed in our lab with computers configured with EyeTracker (SMI250) and KeyStroke Logger (Translog-II). These data was further processed to align source token to target token by the users and then finally stored to the TPR(Translation Process Research) Database.\n",

Such activation in the user's mind may affect the word-production time.\n",
